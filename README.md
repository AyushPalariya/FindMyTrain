🛤️ Find My Train – Project Description
"Find My Train" is a full-stack train tracking and inquiry application designed to help users check the real-time status, availability, and schedule of trains. The application is built with a simple
and intuitive user interface and a powerful backend that communicates with the database and APIs.

The application exposes RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and backend. These APIs fetch train information, schedules, and real-time updates, returning structured JSON data. 
The project is managed with Maven, which simplifies dependency management and project builds.
